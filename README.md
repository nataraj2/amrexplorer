AMReXplorer is a C++20 and Qt 6 desktop application for interactive visualization
of AMReX data. One executable opens 2-D and 3-D plotfiles as well as standalone
FAB and MultiFab data.

## Highlights

- Demand-driven AMR reads with a bounded data cache
- IEEE-32 and IEEE-64 FAB input
- First-class raw MultiFab and FAB exploration, including per-dimension
  cell/nodal index types, ghost-cell-aware MultiFab views, multi-file FAB
  selection, and full stored-FAB inspection
- Composite and exact-level views, value probing, line plots, grid boxes,
  contours, and vector glyphs
- Three orthogonal slice views and an isometric overview for 3-D data
- 2-D spherical (r, θ) plotfiles rendered in physical R–Z, or as the logical
  r–θ / θ–r grid
- Plotfile-sequence and plane-sweep animation
- Remote plotfiles and sequences: the client runs its server on the remote
  machine through ssh, no ports or tunnels involved
- Multiple palettes, logarithmic and user-defined ranges, and PNG/FITS/MP4 export

## Documentation

- **[Installation](INSTALL.md)** — dependencies, source builds, and packaged
  applications
- **[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** — workflows, controls, animation,
  export, shortcuts, and troubleshooting
- **[Developer Build Guide](docs/building.md)** — CMake presets, supported
  compilers, and validation
- **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — layering, the dataset-session
  abstraction, threading, and trust boundaries (for contributors)

The User Guide is also bundled in the application under **Help > User
Guide...** for offline use.
