// beside a slice of the same field with the same range is read as the same
// picture, and a colour bar drawn from the palette has to agree with both.
//
// Slot 0 at or below the minimum, the last slot at or above the maximum,

// cannot hoist it out of a pixel or sample loop on its own.

//   - At the top of the range, for about one span in seven (e.g. [0, 49]), a
//     value equal to the maximum normalizes to just under 1.0 and truncates
//     into the second-to-last slot while a colour bar shows the last.

//     divides to exactly 0.5 (slot 126) but multiplies to 0.49999999999999994
//     (slot 125). Only about three interior floats in a hundred thousand
//     shift, but they are the round ones -- midpoints and similar -- which are
//     the ones a reader is most likely to check.
//
// A sweep of *random* spans and values shows no interior disagreement, which
// is what makes this worth a comment: random doubles essentially never land on
// the ties, so sampling does not find them and only the exact cases do. Keep
