// The pixel size to ray-cast the volume at: the view in *device* pixels for a
// frame that will stay up, half the view's *logical* size for a draft. Both
// bounded to at least one pixel and at most maxVolumeOutputDimension.
//
// Device pixels for the settled frame because a frame rendered at logical size
// is stretched into a view whose wireframe and slice planes are drawn at the
// display's real resolution -- a soft picture under sharp lines, and no
// Quality setting recovers it, because the pixels were never asked for. The
// slice path has always sized its requests this way
// (MainWindow::viewportPixelSize); the volume path had not.
//
// Drafts deliberately ignore the ratio. They exist to keep a moving camera and
// a playing sequence responsive, and scaling them would multiply the cost of
// exactly the frames that get thrown away: a draft is the same size on a
// hi-DPI display as anywhere else, and only the frame that stays gets the
// extra pixels. So the step from draft to settled is larger on such a display
// than on a 1x one -- which is the point, since that is where the settled
// frame was worst.
//
// The ratio is a parameter rather than read from the widget here, which is
// what lets the rule be tested without a scaled platform.

// the domain, so intersecting all three gives, per axis, the narrower of the
// two views that show it. With nothing zoomed every region is the domain and
// the answer is the domain, which is what an unlimited render asks for anyway.
//
// Two views can disagree past overlapping: zoom the YZ view into the bottom of
// z and the XZ view into the top and no z is visible in both. Such an axis
// falls back to the whole domain rather than collapsing the box -- there is no
// z both views show, so narrowing it would be a guess, and an empty box is not
// renderable at all.
//
// Worth the narrowing because the grid is sized from the region: volumeGridDims
// counts the region's own cells and only downsamples if they exceed the voxel
// budget, so a small enough region is sampled at the finest level's pitch
// instead of a coarsened one.
