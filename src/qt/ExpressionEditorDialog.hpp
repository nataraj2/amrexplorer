// buttons. Pure presentation -- it validates nothing and knows nothing about
// the open dataset. It edits a *draft* of the list and asks the host to accept
// it (applyRequested), which either replaces the draft with what was accepted
// or shows a reason in place (showError); Import and Export are the host's too,
// since only it can run a file dialog and parse the format.
//
// Names are kept as typed. An empty one is shown as "(unnamed)" in the list
// and refused by the host, which is where every rule about a definition lives.
//
// It shows two things about the open dataset without knowing anything about
// it: the stored field names an expression may use (setStoredFields) and,
// while a definition is being written, why this dataset could not provide it
// (showResolutionWarning). Both are handed in by the host, which resolves the
// draft as it changes -- draftEdited says when that is.
